                    Dear Participants,
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for your interest! In this study, you will:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        You will be shown 96 simple scenes containing different objects. Before viewing each scene, you will be asked a question about the scene
                        and tasked with answering that question as fast as possible when you see the scene.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are being asked to participate in a project being conducted by a research team at Harvard University, under the direction of Dr. Tomer Ullman. 
                    We are interested in how people are able to reason quickly and in a commonsense way about the different objects and people they encounter in the world around them. 
                    A better understanding of commonsense reasoning has implications for building more intelligent machines that can reason in a more human-like way, lowering risk in 
                    different physical situations. During this study, you will be presented with textual descriptions of scenes. To assess your resulting mental image, you will be asked 
                    questions and you will respond by selecting an appropriate response. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The study will last around 10 minutes. Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You may refuse to participate, or you may choose to 
                    withdraw from participation at any time, without penalty or loss of benefit to which you are otherwise entitled. There has been no harm to people involved 
                    in this study and there are no risks associated with participation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All information collected from the study will be associated with a randomly generated Prolific code number or Prolific ID, which 
                    is the only identifying data you will be requested to provide. Unless your profile is set to private, MTurk ID’s can be used to link back to user account. 
                    We suggest you set your profile to private. This ID will be changed to Study IDs upon payment. Only researchers associated with this project will have access 
                    to the data. In order to make a research transparent to the scientific and broader community our study design and unidentifiable data might be made publicly 
                    available on Open Science Framework, a network of research materials and collaboration software, but your data will not be in anyway identifiable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will also provide you with a demographic questionnaire. The form does not include any personal identifying information other than your Prolific ID. Your 
                    contribution to this questionnaire is voluntary; if you choose to provide the requested information, your responses will be confidential. You will be reimbursed 
                    at a rate of [$10/hr] for your participation. You might be requested to provide you Mechanical Turk ID for reimbursement purposes, but these numbers will be deleted 
                    immediately after reimbursement.
